# EmployeeRetentionPredictiveAnalysis
Background:
Frequent voluntary turnover has a negative impact on employee morale, productivity, and company revenue. Recruiting 
and training a new employee requires staff time and money. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, turnover is highest in 
industries such as trade and utilities, construction, retail, customer service, hospitality, and service.

Objective:
The purpose of this project is to build several models that predict employee retention/turnover of employees. 
The sample data is from employees' previous exit interviews. The data set contains variables such as employee satisfaction, 
number of projects, salary level,last evaluation, average monthly hours, position, time at the company, promotion during last five years, 
and work accidents.
